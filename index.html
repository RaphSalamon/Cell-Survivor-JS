        <p>Welcome to Biofilm Buster. You are an experimental bacteriophage designed to attack species of pathogenic bacteria found in hospitals. Due to a breakthrough in synthetic biology, you have the ability to precisely control your hosts' internal machinery. This allows you to strategically "steer" your hosts and mutate yourself at a faster rate than any natural bacteriophage.
        <br>
        The scientists who engineered you hope this will make you a match for tough, highly antibiotic-resistant biofilms. You are currently in a petri dish with several species of target pathogens. Your task: eradicate an entrenched K. Pneumoniae biofilm.
        </p>
        <p><em>Can you beat the bad bacteria?</em></p>

        <p>Tips:
        <ul>
          <li>So long as the number of phages doesn't equal zero, you are still "alive".</li>
          <li>Without host cells to "steer," you cannot engineer yourself and do not have control over whether you encounter enemies.</li>
          <li>The higher your virulence, the more effectively you can attack (and infect) colonies.</li>
        </ul>
